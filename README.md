  + If you want to change the project that executes when pressing CTRL+F5 in VS then right click on the desired project in the project      explorer. Then choose the option "Set as startup project"

+ For Week 1 Session 1 & 2 --
  + Similar to week 1, multiple projects for each challenges - including additional challenges.  
  + Download zip and unzip, try to load the `.sln` file if you can using VStudio, if not possible (due to linking issue, you can open the individual project.
  + If that does not work, you can open the `.cpp` in your text editor

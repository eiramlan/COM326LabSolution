# COM326 Lab Solution
## Weekly Challenge Solutions

Solutions will be posted here weekly (I will try to get it up by Friday every week). If you the weekly solution, and it is not yet available by Friday, do let me know on Discord / email.

+ For Week 1 Session 1 & 2 --
  + The Repo consists of three Visual Studio projects, one for each of the challenges.
  + If you want to change the project that executes when pressing CTRL+F5 in VS then right click on the desired project in the project      explorer. Then choose the option "Set as startup project"

+ For Week 2 Session 1 --
  + Similar to week 1, multiple projects for each challenges - including additional challenges.  
  + Download zip and unzip, try to load the `.sln` file if you can using VStudio, if not possible (due to linking issue, you can open the individual project.
  + If that does not work, you can open the `.cpp` in your text editor  

+ Week 3 All Solutions --
  + Due to the size of VS studio project files (even after compressing them), I've decided to only upload the .h/.hpp and .c/.cpp files. You should be able to create console application by now and add the files yourself :)
  + Keep the `Student` and `RPG` class handy as we are going to explore the solution further in future sessions.
  + Ideally, you should have these projects in your repository for easy access - pull directly to VStudio using github.

+ Week 4 All Solutions --
  + Uploaded into two seperate folders  
  
+ Week 5 Solutions --
  + Include the refactoring exercise at the end of Lab 2 for Tic-Tac-Toe

+ Week 7 Solutions --
  + The usual stuffs

+ Week 8 Solutions --
  + Lab 1 - contains the Unit Testing module project, you should be able to add this folder into your Student Module project. The links for StudentModel is available here: https://github.com/eiramlan/StudentModule
  + Lab 2 - contains the modified StudentModule, with advanced C++ challenges

+ Week 9 Solutions --  
  + For week 9, remember that you are supposed to fork the solution to your repository, and work on your own RPG Battle System. You can use this solution as a base line. You are free to build on it, incorporating more logic to the various actions. Once you have completed your won RPG battle system, send me a message - I would love to check it out. Your solution might be selected as an example for COM326 class next semester

__NOTE:__ These are sample solutions - as mentioned (repeatly) in class, you can have many solutions to the problem at hand. Don't feel shy to explore your own solution. You can observe a lot by looking at the various logic applied to these solutions. You might infact apply your own logic, which could be more efficient that ones provided here.
